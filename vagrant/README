Vagrant configuration that simulates ecloud development infrastructure environment. It builds, starts and configures 3 machines:
- services: tomcat configured with the jndi variables,you can access tomcat after node started through:
http://172.16.0.100:8080/manager/html (manager pass: admin/password)
- cassandra: with schema and permissions created
- swift: build with a loopback device as storage and tempauth(no keystone)

Requirements:
vagrant : follow instructions https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/
virtualbox : install via https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
(it should work with other vm managers e.g. vmware but is only tested with virtualbox)

How to:
To start all nodes at once (make sure you have enough memory)
$ vagrant up

To start a individual node
$ vagrant up <node>
e.g.
$ vagrant up cassandra

To stop (but save the state of node)
$ vagrant suspend <node>

To stop node and wipe out virtual machine from your system
$ vagrant destroy <node>
