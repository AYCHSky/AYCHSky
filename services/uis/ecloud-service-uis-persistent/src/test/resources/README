Since there is a bug in EmbeddedCassandra that prevents running prepared statement if JAMM has not been 
configured. Do the following to successfully run the unit test

from command line (Linux/Mac):
export JVM_OPTS = $JVM_OPTS -javaagent:{path to UIS Persistent service}src/test/resources/jamm-0.2.5.jar

from command line (WINDOWS)
set JVM_OPTS = $JVM_OPTS -javaagent:{path to UIS Persistent service}src/test/resources/jamm-0.2.5.jar

From Eclipse

Create an environmental variable in the Run Configuration and append in the VM options

 -javaagent:src/test/resources/jamm-0.2.5.jar
